<br> Made the GUI with python Tkinter, kaggle data stored with excel and SQL, data communication with pickle files <br>

Multiple clients can connect to the same server/(admin) 

The clients need to log in, when logged in they can request data from the server visualised in a chart, 
the data can be requested with input parameters.
<br> the clients can also read a message from the admin<br>
<br> clients can log out<br>


<br> the server/admin can see which clients are logged in and request every client's data <br>
<br> the server/admin has an action log, the server/admin can also send a message to all clients<br>
<br> the admin can import and export a CSV-file, data from the CSV-file can be saved in a  database <br>
